# Surfs_Ups
#Purpose:
We are looking at Hawaiiâ€™s historical data from June to December to see if opening a surf and ice cream shop would be a worth wild endeavor. We will be looking at only December and Junes average temperatures due to the fact they are in different parts of the year. Once we create the Data frames, we run summarily statistics to give come help us conclude.  

#Results:
-	Neither temperature in the months tested eclipsed 90 degrees. 
-	Junes 25, 50, and 70 average temperatures where greater than Decembers 
-	The standard deviation between June and December .5 between them.   
	
#Conclusion:
What conclusions we can draw from the data from the data collected was. Is that having numbers like we see that there is potential in opening a surf/ice cream shop is the temperatures with a mean sitting between 71 and 74 for December and June. The temperature does serve to be nice enough year-round so that surf shop and ice cream stand would be something lucrative. But without more info we cant get a good idea of how well a surf shop will do to the nature of surfing being a primarily an outside activity.
